## Minimum recommended tests to have in every role
# process:
#   exec_name:
#     running: true
# user:
#   example_user:
#     exists: true
#     groups:
#       - example_group
#     shell: /usr/sbin/nologin
# group:
#   example_group:
#     exists: true
#
## Tests to check if the needed directories were created propperly 
# file:
#   bin_path:
#     owner: example_user
#     group: % example_group
#     exists: true
#     filetype: directory
#
## Check if ports are really exposed
# port:
# # Check port at IPv6
# # https://github.com/aelsabbahy/goss/issues/177
#   tcp6:<port>:
#     listening: true
#     ip:
#     - '::'
